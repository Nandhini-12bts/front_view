            <ul>
                <li><em>Location:</em> Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India</li>
                <li><em>Built:</em> 1631-1653</li>
                <li><em>Area:</em> 17 hectares (42 acres)</li>
                <li><em>Height:</em> 73 m (240 ft)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful and well-known buildings in the world. It was built
                by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his late wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth
                to the couple's 14th child. It is said to have taken 20,000 men and 22 years to complete.

                The Taj Mahal is located in Agra, India, and is an example of Mughal architecture, which
                combines Indian, Persian, and Islamic influences. This glorious structure is made of marble
                and has a main tomb chamber with a sarcophagus. It also includes a gigantic garden with a
                reflecting pool.

                The Taj Mahal is considered a symbol of love and peace and it is also a UNESCO World Heritage
                Site.</p>

                <li><em>Size:</em> 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical
                northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various
                nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th
                century BC,
                with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220-206 BC), the first emperor of
                China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained
                multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by
                the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).
                <br>
            <p>There are many stories about why the wall was built. Some say that it was built to prevent
                attacks by fierce nomadic tribes from the north. Others think that it was built to keep out
                armies of invaders. However, academics have stated that it worked more as “political propaganda.”

                Today, the Great Wall is a popular tourist attraction in China and thousands of people flock to
                it each year.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><em>Location:</em> Yucatán, Mexico</li>
                <li><em>Built:</em> AD 600-1200</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal
                Classic period. The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State,
                Mexico.

                Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic
                (c. AD 600-900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800-900) and into the early portion
                of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900-1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural
                styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of
                the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to
                have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but
                most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as
                the result of cultural diffusion.

                Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the
                mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city
                may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have
                contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Machu Picchu is an ancient Incan city that is located in present-day Peru. The city
                was built in the 15th century and is situated on a mountain ridge above the Urubamba
                River valley. Machu Picchu is one of the most well-known and popular tourist
                destinations in Peru, as well as being one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

                The city was built around 1450, but it was abandoned just a century later at the time
                of the Spanish conquest. The Incas never revealed their location to the Spanish
                conquerors, so Machu Picchu was undiscovered for almost 400 years. When Machu
                Picchu was rediscovered in 1911, it became one of the most famous archaeological
                sites in South America. The site is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and receives
                approximately half a million visitors each year.</p>

            <p>Christ the Redeemer is a world-famous statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The statue is of
                Jesus Christ and is located on top of Corcovado Mountain.

                Created by Heitor da Silva Costa, Paul Landowski, and Carlos Oswald, the statue was built
                in 1931 and stands at 98 feet (not including the base) and has an arm span of 92 feet.

                Christ the Redeemer is a popular tourist destination and receives millions of visitors
                each year. It is truly a beautiful sight to behold and is definitely worth a visit.</p>

            <p>As one of the oldest cities in the world, Petra is an archaeological wonder in Jordan.

                The city eventually fell, however, as trade routes changed and two major earthquakes,
                363 and 551, respectively) caused more complexity, Petra was eventually abandoned.

                The city was hidden for centuries by the surrounding cliffs and was only rediscovered
                in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
                and one of the Seven Wonders of the World.</p>

            <p>The Colosseum in Italy was built in 70 and 80 AD and was the largest amphitheater in the world.
                This magnificent structure is made of concrete and stone and is considered one of
                the greatest achievements of Roman architecture.

                Every year, millions of tourists visit the Colosseum to see its grandeur for themselves.
                It measures 620 by 513 feet, which is larger than an American football field! It is also
                estimated that over 50,000 people could be seated in the Colosseum at one time.

                The Colosseum was used for gladiator fights and public spectacles such as mock sea battles,
                animal hunts, executions, and re-enactments of famous battles and dramas. On average, it is
                estimated that 550,000 people were killed in the Colosseum, and so many animals died that
                some species even became extinct.</p>
